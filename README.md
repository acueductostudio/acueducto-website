## To consider
- Friends is not too professional, think about it, especially because of the amount of  case  studies, combine  with contact footer?

- Form doesn't make sense, dissonance with the budget might give the illusion of we being  able to work for the  selected  budget and then starting  with the  wrong  foot as we say no we can't do what you're asking  with that money.
- If there's no budget, why the form?
- if there's no form, why the contact page?

- Title type? and copy for titles you should  be able to scan it and tell a story on their  own

- What makes us the most special? That in home  page

- Don't repeat components / but portfolio one? would have to be smaller

- We know you're looking  for  agencies, we're looking  for clients too and we'll also choose the right fit.
