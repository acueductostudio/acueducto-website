## To consider 
- "Friends" is not too professional, especially because of the amount of  case  studies
- Copy for titles: you should be able to scan them and they should and tell a story on their own
- What's our main diferentiator? What makes us the most special? (section)
- Don't repeat components / portfolio component would have to be smaller/different
- "We know you're looking for agencies, we're also looking for clients to partner with and we'll also choose the right fit.
